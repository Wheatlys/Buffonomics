11/7: Discussed what each team member is currently working on and what troubles anyone is currently encountering. Elijah and Stephen are working on the backend for the login/registration pages so that users can properly sign up and their data is stored in a table, with user passwords being hashed for security. Ali is working on the dashboard/homepage front end so that the styling matches the login/registration pages. The rest of the members were not able to attend the meeting and our TA informed us that they will either need to be present next week or other team members will need to be able to explain what they have been working on in order for the absent team members to receive credit for their individual evaluation.
